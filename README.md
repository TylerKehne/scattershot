# scattershot
WIP of c++ port/refactor of Krithalith's scattershot algorithm for SM64 TASing, who is mostly responsible for the existence of this project. Fifdspence also made improvements to state encoding compression. My improvements are focused on readability and maintenance going forward, as well as future integration with my TAS scripting framework.
